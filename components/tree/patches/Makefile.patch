# Patch origin internal.
# Not to be sent upstream, because changes to this native Makefile were intended
# to be part of the build process.
#
# Of the suggested Solaris lines, only XOBJS (specific to this compoent) should
# be set here.
# The rest (CC, CFLAGS, LDFLAGS, MANDIR) need to be set by the Userland build
# environment to get the correct values.
